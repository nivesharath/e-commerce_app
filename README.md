# E-Commerce Database Management System (Team-24)

**Project Overview**

This project creates a relational database for an E-Commerce platform, based on the Brazilian e-commerce public dataset by Olist (sourced from Kaggle). The system manages data about customers, orders, products, sellers, reviews, payments, and geolocation.

**It is designed to:**

- Efficiently store, update, and query large-scale e-commerce transactional data.

- Ensure referential integrity, data normalization (BCNF), and scalability.

- Support complex queries and optimize query performance.

- The database supports both querying and updating operations.

**Files Provided**

**create.sql:** SQL script to create the database schema.

**Milestone 2 Report.pdf:** Detailed report describing project tasks, E/R diagrams, BCNF analysis, queries, indexing, and optimization.

**How to Run**

**Create the database:**

CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;

**Execute the schema creation:**

Run the create.sql script in your PostgreSQL environment (e.g., PgAdmin, psql).

**Load sample data:**

Manually insert small test datasets (around 10 entries per table) to debug easily.

For production, load cleaned CSV data using PostgreSQL's import features.

**Execute queries:**

Run various SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE queries (examples are given in the project report).

**Database Schema**

**Main Tables:**

geolocation

product_category_translation

customers

sellers

products

orders

order_items

order_payments

order_reviews

**Key Design Features**

- All relations are in Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).

- Referential integrity enforced with primary and foreign keys.

- Indexes created on foreign keys and frequently filtered columns to improve performance.

- Dataset supports analytical queries like joins, subqueries, GROUP BY, and aggregations.

**Datasets Used**

**Kaggle:** Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist

**Example Queries (Provided in Report)**

- Aggregate orders by status

- Find top customers by number of orders

- Revenue calculation per seller

- Payment analysis using subqueries

**Challenges Faced**

Slow queries on large datasets (~600K+ rows).

Solved by creating targeted indexes and using EXPLAIN ANALYZE for query planning.

Recommended partitioning and materialized views for very large tables.

**Bonus**

Building a web interface to visualize and interact with the database.

**Individual Contribution (Nivedhithaa Karunanidhi)**
- Designed and implemented SQL queries for order analysis, revenue calculations, and customer insights.
  
- Worked on database normalization (BCNF) and indexing strategies to optimize performance.
  
- Assisted in building schema diagrams and ensuring referential integrity across tables.

- Built an interactive and creative streamlit dashboard to show different results through the app.
